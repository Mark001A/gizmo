----------------
Bugs and Feature Requests.  Feel free to add.

- Request: Set path on startup to include the gizmo directory and the
  scripts directory (scripts after gizmo).

- Request: some control over where the proxied data is stored.
  My typical webscarab use is to save a session in one dir,
  run some tests, then start saving into another dir to run
  other tests.

- the request has no indication if it is http or https.  This
  means that scripts have no way to figure it out if they need
  to do things like replay a request.
  (btw, response editing might want to keep a way to access
  the matching request for a similar reaosn -- in case someone
  wants to take info from a response and build up a request based
  on it.  For symmetry prob there should be a way to access a 
  response when editing a request).

- There's no feedback about errors in script commands.  There's
  no indication that the script even ran or that it completed.
  All error messages are silently thrown away.  This makes it hard
  to diagnose errors and also leaves you wondering sometimes if
  it actually tried to do anything..

- Request: some macro/rewrite rule system on commands.
  For example, I would like ">" at the start of a command
  to rewrite to "to " and "<" at the start of a command to
  rewrite to "frm" and "|" at the start of a command to
  rewrite to "filt" to support easier use of
  frm.bat, to.bat and filt.bat.  I don't think these should
  necessarily be hardwired into the system (although 
  maybe that's a simpler solution if it turns out other people
  dont really have rewrite rules they want to use).



----------------
Done.  These have been resolved, or rejected.

- proxy doesn't handle the port properly.  ie. go to
  http://labs:8001/ in proxy and you'll get http://labs/

- modifying $REQ with an editor command doesnt have anye effect
  on the request after the editor command finishes.
