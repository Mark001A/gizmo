FEATURE Requests:
All requests/responses
  - general summary tool.  runs over all requests and responses
    that are shown and optionally show url parameters, post
    parameters, sent cookies, set-cookie responses, forms in
    response.  this might be one tool with flags or several
    tools.
  - tool for encoding or decoding all requests and responses?
    - ie. deflate, gzip.

One request or response:
  - tool for opening editable form in browser that lets you
    tweak the posted data - done already
    (note: nice bonus, all forms you submit in the browser
     will generate gizmo logs when browser is configured
     to use proxy).
  - tool for opening editable form in browsre for tweaking
    the URL parameters.
  - tool for opening a page with all of the forms from the
    chosen response, except all fields editable and none hidden.

  - tool for editing req parameters (url and post).  This just
    takes the params out of the original, lets you edit them,
    then puts them back in.  you'd use gizmo "send" to send
    it after tweaking.
  - tool for editing req cookies.

  - tool for invoking certain toolbar modules on the current
    request's URL.  maybe some way to specify certain fields
    to fuzz or others to exclude.  Cookies will get carried over
    to toolbar test case.

Text in a request or response:
  - tool for encoding and decoding various selected data    
    - base64, modified base 64, with and without trailing ='s
    - url encoding
    - extra url encoding for obfuscation
    - non-minimal utf8 encoding
    - gzip, bzip2, deflate, ...
  - tool for displaying decoded data
    - utf8 to unicode
